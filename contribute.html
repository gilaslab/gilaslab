        <h2> Use our resources! </h2>
        <p> 
          We are releasing open-source resources for people interested in developing NLP systems for Azerbaijani.
          Your first contribution to our cause would be using these resources (maybe provide feedback). If you have used our datasets or models to build something, we would love to hear your story.
        </p>
        <h2> Open source </h2>
        <p> 
          We also encourege our users to contribute to the process. This can include pull requests on GitHub,
          but also simpler (although as important!) things like  feature requests and bug reports.
        </p>
        <h2> Mentorship program </h2>
        <p> 
          We are unable to offer a paid internship at this time, but we offer mentorship to ambitious 
          individuals who want to get started in open-source NLP projects. You can send us an email at <a href = "mailto: jafar.isbarov@prodata.az">jafar.isbarov@prodata.az</a>.
